More importantly, we will be buying more of this so long as Amazon holds the price down. <br /> <br /> This version of canned spaghetti is most suitable for three groups of people: kids who like its sweet and somewhat bland taste; parents who are desperately seeking a quick and easy way to put something in front of the kids; <UNK> <UNK> who are trying to stretch their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>. As my title suggests, these cans are really <UNK> for the broke and weary . They aren't going to win any gourmet <UNK>, but they will keep you alive so long as you can <UNK> a <UNK> <br /> <br /> Here are some more specific comments that are a bit more critical but not meant to take away from the overall value of this spaghetti: <br /> <br /> 1 . Spaghetti sauce should have a tart, tangy, and <UNK> taste . This version is on the sweet side, probably because Chef <UNK> knows that that's what kids <UNK> <br /> <br /> 2 . Spaghetti sauce should also, in my opinion, have distinctive <UNK> from things like garlic, basil, onions, bay leaves, and whatever else a chef finds lying around the kitchen . The Chef <UNK> version has very little <UNK>, probably because the company knows that kids don't have adult palates and are more likely to go for something a bit <UNK> <br /> <br /> 3 . Spaghetti noodles should be cooked <UNK> (some degree of <UNK>). The noodles in these cans are more along the lines of <UNK>. But they're about as good as you're going to get in cans. <br /> <br /> 4 . The meatballs that come in this product are fairly decent . Actually, if The <UNK> <UNK> is to be believed, <UNK> <UNK> introduced meatballs to his spaghetti sauce not because <UNK> made it that way (they didn't) but because he discovered Americans couldn't <UNK> well with the idea of a <UNK> entree . You really don't need meatballs to be authentic, but if you (and the kids) want them anyway, this is about as good as you're going to get in canned <UNK> <br /> <br /> The people who complain about this product should probably treat it as a base and add in some more tomato sauce along with garlic, onions, basil, and so forth . And sprinkle parmesan cheese as a topping . It's not that <UNK> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a very good value right now, and it's a whole lot better than discovering you're broke because of spending your <UNK> <UNK> on gourmet spaghetti meals .

Instead of taking the prescribed antibiotics I took her to a Chinese <UNK> doctor and got her an herbal treatment . After a few days she was fine. <br /> China, unfortunately has been a very poor and dirty country and also not controlled by any healthy system to prevent problems . Their doctors know this and do very well after thousands of years treating diseases from this condition . If I would not eat this treat, if I am afraid to eat it, I will not give it to my pet and I certainly do not want to pay for two doctor's bills for the cheap treat again .

      "Target:  I've been suffering some fairly severe health issues for the last few months, due to <UNK> <UNK>. In my research on this, I've discovered that <UNK> <UNK> can overload the liver and <UNK>. Well, recently I realized that my <UNK> are much stronger than before, so something else was <UNK>, resulting in my feeling <UNK> constantly . When I developed a <UNK> on my <UNK>, I figured my <UNK> system was <UNK>. I bought a liver detox kit and used it for a few weeks, but I didn't really notice any results. <br /> <br /> Then I found websites talking about <UNK> tea . I had never heard of it, but people were making some pretty remarkable claims about it . As per usual, I immediately came to amazon to see what people here had to say about it (I feel confident that the reviews here are authentic). When I <UNK> in \"<UNK> tea\" in the search <UNK>, it brought up <UNK> <UNK>. This product had terrific reviews, and I'd read how great it is for <UNK>; so I figured, what have I got to lose? <br /> <br /> People claim that it has cured their cancer . I can't make a comment on that, because as far as I know, I've got no cancer . But after taking this tea for a few days, I can definitely state that it seems quite potent <UNK>. I've been taking 2 oz . of the brewed tea with 2 oz . hot water, 3 times a day . The third day I started feeling the typical <UNK> symptoms of detox, and by day 4 I woke up feeling like a truck had hit me . My allergies and chemical sensitivities got really bad . I had a lot of sinus <UNK>. I could feel this stuff working . It's been a little over a week now, and it's still working great . I think the worst of the detox is over . I also started taking milk <UNK> and <UNK> with vitamin C, and I think those supplements are <UNK> in the <UNK> <br /> <br /> Also, my boyfriend who never really thought he had digestive tract issues started taking this tea, just to maintain his health . Within a few days, he started seeing some nasty stuff (i.e . <UNK>, etc) come out in his bowel movements . So I guess this tea is also terrific for actually killing any <UNK> one may have . I can't say that it will do so for everyone, but he and I are both having success with the tea . We even recommended it to his parents to try and are telling our friends about it . It's not difficult to brew at all . After reading reviews where people said it was hard to do, I expected it to be <UNK>. It really doesn't take that long to prepare . Most of the time is spent allowing the tea to brew overnight . When I make the tea, I'd say it takes me about 30 minutes in the evening and about 10 minutes the following morning. <br /> <br /> If you're looking to detox, give this a go . Don't increase the dosage beyond the recommended amount (as I'm <UNK> to do, because I always want to speed things up!), because if you do, you'll feel awful . But this day in age, I think it's all vital that we complete a detox every few months or so . Our bodies simply have yet to catch up with the <UNK> overload created by the modern world . I've tried a few detox remedies, and this one, by far, is my favorite . I intend to use this tea for a very long time, if not for life . <EOS>\n",
